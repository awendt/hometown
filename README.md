# My Hometown Is Better Than Yours

> Seattle is objectively superior to the place you grew up.

When I read Michael Hobbes' [hilarious blog post on Seattle](http://rottenindenmark.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/my-hometown-is-better-than-yours/), I thought: I should do this for *my* hometown.

And then I realized: Everybody should be doing this for their hometown...

So here you go: A basic template to show off how much better your hometown is! Tell the world about it by adding your hometown to [myhometownisbetterthanyours.com](http://www.myhometownisbetterthanyours.com)
